## What I have learned
 * Do not set a height and a width to your divs.
 * If a column is set to "auto", the grid will be responsive and span to the extend it can in the container.
 * Fraction units are units that help managing the size of columns so they can all be equal no matter how responsive the site can be.
 * Grid template areas are a visual representation of a grid
 * Areas template are only valid if they are rectangles.
 * Auto-fit fills out the grid with as many columns as it can The entire width of the column is used.
 * The minmax function helps fixing that issue by giving minimun and maximum values to the column as the space is made available.
