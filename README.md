## What I have learned
 * Do not set a height and a width to your divs.
 * If a column is set to "auto", the grid will be responsive and span to the extend it can in the container.
 * Fraction units are units that help managing the size of columns so they can all be equal no matter how responsive the site can be.
 * Grid template areas are a visual representation of a grid
 * Areas template are only valid if they are rectangles.
 * Auto-fit fills out the grid with as many columns as it can The entire width of the column is used.
 * The minmax function helps fixing that issue by giving minimun and maximum values to the column as the space is made available.
 * Padding in an anchor tag defines the area of the tag that can be clicked and hovered over.
 * For the image container, we have to make sure all the images have the same exact size of the image container.
 * The width of the container that holds all the images must be equal to the width of all images combined but the height remains the same.
 * The "overflow:hidden" property will stack the images one upon the other.
 * The width shouldn't be defined if we want to make the slider/image-slider responsive.
